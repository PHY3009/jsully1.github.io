title: November

November has been a month of opposites. It has been beautiful many days of the week (right
now it is sunny and gorgeous), but it gets dark at 5pm. Half the day is spent in darkness,
a time when our body wants to rest, but they are often the most productive parts of my day.

It is also a month of revamped energy, rallying to face the long winter months to come. 
The temperature has dropped dramatically though, and combined with the darkness, much of 
the transition into winter demands more sleep, warmer clothes, and massive amounts of food.
